>What is a hash table?

A: type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a key, forming key-value pairs, just like JavaScript objects.

>What is hashing?

A:  Hashing is the conversion from a string to a numerical index. 

>How does a hash table store data?

A: Hash tables, like arrays, are intended to be used as collections of similar data. They are commonly used to store data by some form of identifier. 

>How are hash tables and objects different?

A: Object’s are really more of a two-dimensional construct in that you have a object with multiple, fixed properties and values for those properties.  Hashtables are more one-dimensional having only a “key” and a “value”.

>Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
A list of pets and their unique names.

A: Object

The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.

A: Object

The name and location of every company in a given city.

A: Object

All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.

A: Hash Table

The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.

A: Hash Table
